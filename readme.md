# Code2PDF

This is a python program to generate a (for now) markdown file containing all the code present in the files of a directory

## How do I use it?

1. Clone the repository or download the python file.
2. Customize the `.ignore` file to your requirements.
3. Run the python file from a folder one level above target folder
    i.e. if your path is Desktop/Code, run this script from Desktop
4. Provide all the right Information
5. Use a markdown viewer/ browser plugin to access the file

## Constraints

* currently only supports syntax highlighting for python. more support to be added later.
* does not convert markdown to PDF
